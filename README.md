Introduction:
In today's digital landscape, secure authentication and key management are paramount for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of systems. FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, provides robust tools for implementing authentication mechanisms and managing cryptographic keys effectively. This code demonstrates a secure authentication system using OAuth2, token-based authentication, and key management functionalities within FastAPI.

Overview:
This FastAPI-based application showcases:

Authentication: Users can authenticate using their credentials (username and password), with passwords securely hashed using bcrypt.
Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, the system generates JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access control, with configurable expiration times.
User Management: Users can retrieve their own information securely, and administrators have the privilege to update client keys.
Key Management: Server keys can be securely generated using OpenSSL, with access restricted to administrative users.
Code Explanation:

Authentication: Utilizes OAuth2PasswordBearer for token-based authentication. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage and verification.
Token Generation: JWT tokens are created upon successful authentication, containing user information and expiration time.
User Management: Users can retrieve their own information, and administrators can update client keys securely.
Key Management: Administrative users can generate new server keys using OpenSSL, ensuring secure key rotation.
Conclusion:
This FastAPI application exemplifies best practices in secure authentication and key management. By leveraging modern cryptographic techniques and robust API frameworks like FastAPI, developers can build resilient and secure systems to protect sensitive data effectively.

update_client_key: This function allows users to securely update their client keys. Both regular users and administrators can update client keys. While administrators can update any user's key, regular users can only update their own keys. Upon successful update, a new JWT (JSON Web Token) is generated for the user.

generate_new_server_key_route: This function enables administrators to generate new server keys using OpenSSL. When a new server key is generated, it's returned only to administrative users.

get_current_time: This function returns the current time. However, it doesn't require any authentication in this example and is open to all users. It simply ensures that the time is presented to the user in their local timezone.
